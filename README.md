# Sample Projects in spare time

Just a sample of spare projects that use a variety of techniques just to practice and demonstrate them. Good to practice stuff so I don't forget how to do it. Trying to use best practice and clean programming to do so as well.

Ideas:
Spiral print numbers
Sudoku using graph theory
Simple chat app - message and voip - sockets, networking
Storage System/Hash Table/Fast lookup
Player rank distribution
Fast Sudoku Solve
Linked List practice
